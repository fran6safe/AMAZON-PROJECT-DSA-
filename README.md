## üí° Business Insights (Summary)

1. **High Discount ‚â† High Rating:** Many discounted items still received poor ratings. Price cuts alone won‚Äôt ensure customer satisfaction.
2. **Most Reviewed Category:** Electronics had the most reviews but also a wide range in satisfaction.
3. **Revenue Optimization:** Focus marketing efforts on mid-priced, highly rated products in "Home Kitchen" and "Accessories".
4. **Product Opportunity:** Products with moderate ratings but high volume reviews may benefit from improved quality or targeted feedback campaigns.
5. **Outlier Products:** A few products drive massive engagement. Promoting these further can help with cross-selling.
