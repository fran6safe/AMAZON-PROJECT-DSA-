# AMAZON-PROJECT-DSA-
A detailed Excel-based analytics project on Amazon product reviews, discounts, and pricing. Designed during my time at DSA Incubator, this project uses pivot tables, slicers, calculated fields, and interactive dashboards to extract actionable insights on product performance, category trends, customer engagement, and revenue opportunities.
